	Abstract = {
The only known blind signature scheme that is secure in the standard
 model~\cite{juels97security} is based on general results about
 multi-party computation, and thus it is extremly inefficient.
 The main  result of this paper is the first  provably secure blind
 signature  scheme which is also efficient.
 We  develop our construction as  follows.
 In the first  step, which  is a  significant result on its
 own,  we devise and prove  the  security of  a new variant for the
 Cramer-Shoup-Fischlin signature  scheme.
 We are able to show that  for generating signatures, instead  of
 using randomly chosen  \textit{prime} exponents one can securely  use
 randomly chosen \textit{odd integer} exponents which significantly
 simplifies  the signature generating  process.
 We obtain our blind signing function as a secure and efficient two-party
 computation that cleverly exploits its algebraic properties and those
 of the Paillier encryption scheme.
 The security of the resulting signing  protocol relies on the Strong
 RSA  assumption and the hardness of  decisional composite
 residuosity; we stress that it does not rely on the existence of
 random oracles.},
