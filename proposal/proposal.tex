% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does  not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\section{Project Idea}

We plan to use Data Dependency tools to determine how system entropy in a given program is used by various cryptographic algorithms. That will allow us to identify if and when entropy is too low or is misused. We can release this as a tool for developers to use as part of a compiler toolchain. We can also use the tool on current projects that might be misusing crypto/entropy. 

We have two motivating examples. First, we would like our tool to be able to detect the issue with the Debian/OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator that was exposed in 2008. Second, we would like to identify potential vulnerabilities in current cryptocurrency wallet code. 

\section{Rough Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Determine data dependency tool (for C/C++) to use, conduct background research (\textit{2 weeks})
	\item Adapt tool to identify the OpenSSL bug (\textit{6 weeks})
	\item Test on other cases like bitcoin wallets (\textit{2 weeks})
	\item Prepare presentation/writeup (\textit{1 week})
	\item Integrate tool into compiler toolchain like clang (\textit{optional})
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Hypothesis}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item An automated tool can detect entropy bugs in real-world programs.
	\item Entropy is insufficiently propagated in programs that rely on cryptography.
\end{enumerate}
